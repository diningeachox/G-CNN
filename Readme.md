#Group-equivariant CNN (G-CNN)

This project is a pytorch implementation of **Group-equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks** by Cohen and Welling.
We create custom G-convolutional layers and G-pooling layers for various noncommutative groups
of interest, namely:

p4 (translations and rotations of 90 degrees)
p4m (translations and rotations of 90 degrees + reflections)


TODO: Optimization using C++ and CUDA
